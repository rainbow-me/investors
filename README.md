# Rainbow Investor Relations

This repository serves as Rainbow's transparency hub for token holders and the community. We voluntarily operate with the kind of openness you'd typically see from a public company.

## About

Rainbow has been building since 2019, creating a mobile-first crypto wallet with best-in-class UX. The Rainbow Foundation holds Class F stock on behalf of $RNBW token holders, representing a novel approach to aligning company and token holder interests.

## What You'll Find Here

Periodically, we publish responses to commonly asked questions from holders and community members. Each release includes:

- **Markdown (.md)** — AI-friendly format for easy analysis
- **PDF** — Formatted document for traditional reading

Our goal is equal, timely access to information about Rainbow's operations and ongoing business plans.
