We are voluntarily trying to operate with the kind of transparency you’d see with a public company. 

We don’t intend to do earnings calls (although that may change based on demand). Instead, periodically, we will publish responses to selected questions received from holders and community members. Our goal is to allow all parties equal and timely access to information about Rainbow’s operations and ongoing business plans.

These are also published in a Github repo to allow for more friendly AI assisted analysis.

The following cover some of the most common questions we’ve received publicly and privately through December 14, 2025.

### How should we think about comps to wallet tokens?

Comps have been a challenge for us as part of the TGE process. It's easy to look at Rainbow, recognize the brand and categorize it a “wallet token.” From our perspective, there has never been a token like $RNBW before, which is what makes comps so challenging.

We’ve made the Rainbow Foundation the largest shareholder of Rainbow through the introduction of a new class of stock (Class F) designed to be held by a Foundation. The Foundation holds those shares on behalf of token holders.

We’ve deeply integrated the token into the product, starting with powering real-time rewards on revenue generating activities such as swaps, perps, and prediction markets.

If we believe that all of finance is moving onchain, the companies that we are ultimately competing with (and should be benchmarked against) are Robinhood, Revolut, and traditional financial institutions as the mobile super apps where you can serve all

### How are you preparing for the sell pressure that every airdrop faces?

Every airdrop has farmers, but there are a few data points we are able to share.

1. Rainbow has been around since 2019. Many of the top points holders are long time users who are constantly offering product feedback. Many of these users have already allocated to participating in the CoinList ICO.
2. Other large users have proactively reached out and told us they love the alignment with the creation of the Class F stock and will HODL their airdrop long term.
3. Whether it’s equity or a token, every company that has a liquid market is constantly working to attract and build its long term holder base. We are no exception. We’re already speaking with and building relationships with investors and liquid funds that are potential long term holders of $RNBW in advance of TGE as part of increasing awareness and potential demand for long term holders.

### What future utility of $RNBW should we expect? Will there be staking?

The $RNBW token is going to be deeply integrated into the Rainbow product in the coming years.

It’s likely that there will be staking of $RNBW natively available within Rainbow at some point in time in the future, although nothing has been decided as of yet. The most obvious lever we’d initially consider in conjunction with staking would relate with fees and/or the amount of $RNBW cash back received, but it’s still highly preliminary and still in the evaluation stage.
